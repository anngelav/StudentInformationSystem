# StudentInformationSystem

About the project:
The Project is about simple Student Information System.
When you run the solution, you can see the main window which contains table with all the registered users and buttons.
The first button is unlock button with image on it, and with clicking the button you can ulock or lock the EDIT button.
While you unlock and lock the EDIT button you can see that the button changes it's color, depenging on the status (enabled/disabled).
When you try to click on the EDIT button you will see MessageBox, because you must select one row (user) from the table, and then you are free to edit.
After clicking on EDIT button you will see new window where you can change the role of the user.
You can choose from one of the roles, but if you make a mistake you will get a message what roles are available.
After the Submit button, the Edit Window will close and you should be able to see the changes in the table.

Known issues:
After clicking on the Submit button that is in the Edit Window the role is not changing in the table, but just in the Edit Window.
You can see the issue after clicking on the same row and the Edit Button twice.

Possible updates:
The project can be expanded by adding LogIn Window before seeing the Main Window, and the user will be able to edit or see other users only if the role is ADMIN and the user is logged with correct username and password.
Can be added samo more features, also.
